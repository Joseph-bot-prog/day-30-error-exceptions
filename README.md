Day-30

A month already? Today's topics was **Errors, Exception and JSON ** in python, which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I learn?

Types of exceptions: FileNotFoundError, KeyError, IndexError and TypeError.

Handling exceptions in python

try:
    ...
except:
    ...
else:
    ...
finally:
    ...
JSON - dump(), load(), update()


Conclusion
To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
